# Propel22 Deployment Options

This document provides an overview of deployment options for the Propel22 application.

## Recommended Deployment: Render

Based on your previous deployment attempts with Railway, Render, and Fly.io, we recommend using **Render** as it offers the most reliable free tier option in 2023.

### Why Render?

- **Free Tier Available**: Unlike Railway and Heroku, Render still offers a free tier for web services, static sites, and PostgreSQL databases (90-day trial)
- **Blueprint Deployment**: Render supports Blueprint deployment using the `render.yaml` file, making it easy to deploy all services at once
- **Reliable Performance**: Render provides good performance for small to medium-sized applications

### Deployment Guides

We've prepared several guides to help you deploy to Render:

1. **[RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./RENDER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)**: Step-by-step instructions for deploying to Render using the Blueprint method
2. **[CREATE_FREE_RENDER_INSTANCE.md](./CREATE_FREE_RENDER_INSTANCE.md)**: Detailed guide on creating free instances on Render
3. **[GITHUB_PUSH_GUIDE_RENDER.md](./GITHUB_PUSH_GUIDE_RENDER.md)**: Instructions for pushing Render deployment changes to GitHub

### Deployment Scripts

We've also provided scripts to help you deploy:

- **[deploy-to-render.ps1](./deploy-to-render.ps1)**: PowerShell script for Windows users
- **[deploy-to-render.sh](./deploy-to-render.sh)**: Bash script for Linux/Mac users

## Alternative Deployment Options

If Render doesn't work for your needs, consider these alternatives:

### 1. Cyclic

- **Free Tier**: Generous free tier with serverless hosting
- **Easy Deployment**: Simple GitHub integration
- **Limitations**: May not support complex applications with multiple services

### 2. Fly.io

If you want to try Fly.io again, refer to:

- **[FLY_DEPLOYMENT.md](./FLY_DEPLOYMENT.md)**: Guide for deploying to Fly.io
- **[deploy-to-fly.ps1](./deploy-to-fly.ps1)** or **[deploy-to-fly.sh](./deploy-to-fly.sh)**: Deployment scripts

### 3. Railway

Railway no longer offers a free tier (minimum $5/month), but if you're willing to pay, refer to:

- **[RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md](./RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md)**: Guide for deploying to Railway
