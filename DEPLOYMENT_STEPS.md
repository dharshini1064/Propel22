## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Changes to GitHub

### 2. Deploy to Railway

#### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (if you have GitHub integration)

If you have set up Railway to automatically deploy from your GitHub repository:

1. The changes will be automatically deployed once you push to GitHub
2. Monitor the deployment in the Railway dashboard

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. Log in to your Railway account
2. Navigate to your Propel22 project
3. Click on the "Deploy" tab
4. Click "Deploy Now" to trigger a new deployment with your latest changes

### 3. Verify the Deployment

1. Once the deployment is complete, open your application URL:
   `https://propel22-client-production-3aac.up.railway.app/`

2. Test the Partners section to ensure it's working correctly

3. Ask your friend in Bangalore to verify they can access the site

### 4. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues after deployment:

1. Check the Railway logs for any errors
2. Verify that the environment variables are correctly set in Railway
3. Ensure the database connection is working properly

### 5. Additional Recommendations

1. Consider setting up a staging environment for testing changes before deploying to production
2. Implement automated tests to catch issues before deployment
3. Set up monitoring and alerts to be notified of any issues in production
